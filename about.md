# About Me

I am a former mathematics graduate student transitioning to a career in software engineering. Most of my recent project experience is with TypeScript, React, and other frontend frameworks and tools. I've also dabbled in Rust, Python, Haskell, and more. I'm a ferocious self-directed learner and love to take on projects that let me learn new things.
